               <h4> Importance of Regular Exercise</h4>
               <p>Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. It helps in controlling weight, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Exercise also improves mood and mental health by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to reap these benefits.</p>

                    <h3>The Role of Balanced Nutrition</h3>
                    <p>Eating a balanced diet is essential for good health. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains provides essential nutrients and antioxidants that support the immune system and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Avoid excessive intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat meals to maintain optimal health.</p>

               <p> Staying hydrated is essential for bodily functions, including digestion, 
                circulation, and temperature regulation. Water helps flush out toxins, 
                supports healthy skin, and prevents dehydration-related complications.
                 Aim to drink at least 8-10 cups of water per day, more during hot weather or when exercising.</p>
